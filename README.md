# World edit scarpet
World edit with scarpet.

**NOT IN ANY WAY RELATED TO PROJECTS BY ENGINEHUB, THE MAKERS OF WORLD-EDIT THE MOD. THIS IS A SEPARATE PROJECT,
REPLICATING THE FEATURES OF WORLD-EDIT INTO A SCRIPT SO IT'S MORE FLEXIBLE TO USE AND DEVELOP, AND BREAKS LESS THINGS.
WHILE WE USE THE NAME WORLD-EDIT, THIS SCRIPT ALSO HAS FEATURES BEYOND WHAT IS IN REGULAR WE, WHICH YOU CAN SEE 
[HERE](/docs/Documentation.md).**

To install and use, create a file called world-edit.sc, and copy paste code from [world-edit.sc](https://github.com/Ghoulboy78/World-edit-scarpet/blob/master/world-edit.sc). Documentation and help can be found [here](https://github.com/Ghoulboy78/World-edit-scarpet/blob/master/docs/Documentation.md), and there's also an in-game help menu.

If you want to contribute, make sure you have read [the contributions manual](/CONTRIBUTING.md) first. This is important to maintain the code structure
and formatting, to make it easier for future contributions. 

NB: It's good practice to read this before every contribution.
This project is a fast-changing WIP, so the code structure and formalities may change, so they may not be the same since
the last time you read.
