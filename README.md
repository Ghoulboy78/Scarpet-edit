# Scarpet-Edit
A helpful app for designing and building. It is inspired by many mods, like World-Edit, but is not directly affiliated
with any of them.

To install and use, go to the [Github Releases section](https://github.com/Ghoulboy78/World-edit-scarpet/releases), grab
the latest release (the first zip file, or the `world-edit.sc` file only if you don't care about translations), and unzip
it either into your world's `scripts` folder if you want it for a single world, or in `.minecraft/config/carpet/scripts`
to use it in any world (note that languages and structures need to be present per world, Scarpet limitation). Documentation
and help can be found [here](https://github.com/Ghoulboy78/World-edit-scarpet/blob/master/docs/Documentation.md), and 
there's also an in-game help menu.

This project is a fast-changing WIP, so the code structure and formalities may change, so they may not be the same since
